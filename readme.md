# steem-transact
### A package for easy transacting on the Steem blockchain

`steem-transact` simplifies interacting with the Steem blockchain, condensing the creation of each type of transaction into one easy-to-use function. Read the documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/nicholas-2/steem-transact/wiki). 

This is a work-in-progress package and for now only contains a single function, creating custom_json transactions. Feel free to add new functions by opening up a pull request, just make sure they behave similarly to the currently existing function.

`steem-transact` is a companion repository to [steem-state](https://github.com/nicholas-2/steem-state), but they do not depend on each other and each is still useful without the other.

## Installation
Simply run `npm install steem-transact` to install.
